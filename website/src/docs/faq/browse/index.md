Frequently Asked Questions about Browse.

## Why can't I see installed sources?

### If the extension language differs from your device's primary language
Enable the source's language at <nav to="sources">, tap on **Filter**, then turn on the language of the desired source.

### If it's an NSFW extension
Navigate to <nav to="browse"> and check the **Show in sources and extensions list** option.

## How can I locate a specific series?
At times, locating a source containing the series you want to read can be challenging.

Here are strategies to help you find it:

1. Search for the series on [Google](https://google.com/) or a database like [MangaUpdates](https://www.mangaupdates.com/).
1. Consider alternate spellings or title variations for the series.
   - Retry searching your sources using the alternate titles you discovered.
1. If you still can't find the series on any source:
   - Search for an extension for the website you found in *step 1* within the [extensions list](/extensions/).

### If you find the series on a specific scanlator or aggregator with an extension
Download the relevant extension, locate it under <nav to="sources">, and proceed to search for the series there.

### If you find the series on a specific scanlator or aggregator without an extension
Check if a request has been made to add the site as an extension [here](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi-extensions/issues) and confirm it's not on the [list of extensions that won't be added back](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi-extensions/blob/master/REMOVED_SOURCES.md).

If it's not requested and not on the exclusion list, you can [submit a request here](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi-extensions/issues/new/choose).

For scanlators or aggregators without an online reader, you can download the series from their website and set it up as a local series.
