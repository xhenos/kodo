# Extensions
Frequently Asked Questions about Extensions.

## What are some recommended extensions and sources?
**Tachiyomi** does not endorse or recommend any source, and there is no best extension.

Instead, we encourage users to spend some time trying out a few sources themselves and discover what sources work best for them.
What works well for somebody else might not work well for you.

::: info Disclaimer
**Tachiyomi** isn't responsible for slow, down, missing chapters, or subpar image quality of sources as it doesn't host content.
:::

## What is a scanlator source?
Non-officially licensed series are translated by scanlators, often found on their websites or [MangaDex](https://mangadex.org/).
Compare with official sources like [MANGA Plus By SHUEISHA](https://mangaplus.shueisha.co.jp) or [VIZ Shonen Jump](https://www.viz.com/shonenjump).
Learn more in this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanlation).

## How do I request new extensions?
[Open an issue](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi-extensions/issues) on **GitHub** if not already there.
Check the removed [extensions list](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi-extensions/blob/master/REMOVED_SOURCES.md) first.

You can find the list of extensions to download [here](/extensions/)

Extensions can be removed due to several reasons:

* Frequent website changes.
* Image scrambling.
* Scanlator removal request.
* Paywall implementation.
