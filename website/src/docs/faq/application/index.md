Frequently Asked Questions about the Application.

## Tachiyomi Preview

**Tachiyomi Preview** is a regularly updated beta version of the app.
It showcases potential upcoming features, but it's more prone to bugs and crashes.

Ideal for users seeking the latest **Tachiyomi** experience, it's essential to [enable auto-backup](/docs/guides/backups#enabling-automatic-backups) to prevent library loss due to issues.

## Automatic Updates Not Working

Some Android skins (e.g., **MIUI**) aggressively save battery, potentially shutting down apps in the background.

Whitelist **Tachiyomi** from your battery saver by going to <nav to="advanced"> and tapping **Disable battery optimization**.

If unsuccessful, try [DontKillMyApp](https://dontkillmyapp.com/) for battery-saving options on your device and workarounds.

## Uninstall Issues

On **Android 10**, a bug emerged preventing **Tachiyomi** uninstallation if a MicroSD card was present.
To resolve this, remove the MicroSD card from your device before uninstalling **Tachiyomi**.
