Frequently Asked Questions about various app settings.

## Why is taking screenshots blocked?
Turn off **Secure Screen** in <nav to="security-and-privacy">.

## What is DNS over HTTPS?
**DNS over HTTPS (DoH)** (in <nav to="advanced">) offers secure DNS resolution through HTTPS, preventing attacks.
Learn more [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-over-tls/). This may help bypass some basic website blocking.

## What are the different installers?
Three installer options are available (in <nav to="advanced">):

* **Legacy**: A fallback installer if the standard **PackageInstaller** doesn't work.
  > This is the default for **MIUI** (i.e. Xiaomi devices).
* **PackageInstaller**: The primary installer option with additional features dependent on the Android version.
  > For instance, it can bypass user prompts when updating extensions on **Android 12**.
* **Shizuku**: Refer to the [Shizuku guide](/docs/guides/shizuku) for details on **Shizuku**'s functionality.
