### Trouble finding a specific series?

If you encounter difficulties while searching for a specific series, consider the following points:

* Double-check your spelling and try again, as some sources might use **Japanese romanized** titles instead of **English** ones.
  > Example: **Boku no Hero Academia** instead of **My Hero Academia**.

* Some sources may use different spellings or wordings for titles.
  > Example: **Bungo Stray Dogs** instead of **Bungou Stray Dogs**

  > Example: **3-gatsu no Lion** instead of **Sangatsu no Lion**.
