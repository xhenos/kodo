# Categories

Organize your favorite series effortlessly with categories that declutter and structure your library.

To manage your categories, navigate to <nav to="categories">.

- You can name and sort categories as you prefer (e.g., by `Genre`, `Reading Status`).
- Add series to multiple categories and control update options through Library settings, even auto-download chapters from chosen categories.
  > If you've enabled **Download new chapters** in the Downloads settings.
