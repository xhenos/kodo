# Updated website

The website was updated to use [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/), a modern
tool that replaces [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/), which was used
by many years in our previous website. This change will make the user usability
better and will also allow contributors to make changes more easier as the
code is more robust and updated to use [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) v3.

Many improvements were done to several pages such as the [download](/download/)
one, which now doesn't require any new additional requests. A new [changelogs](/changelogs/)
page was also added to keep the history of all changes done in the app through time.

This page is part of the new [news](/news/) section in the website, which
will be used in ocasions like this to keep you informed. We hope these changes
will make the users experience better and keep the information more easy to find.

As we're still in the process of rewritting and updating part of the
documentation and the guides, errors might be present in the texts. If you
find any, please report by opening an issue in the [site repository](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/website/issues/new/choose)
on GitHub.
