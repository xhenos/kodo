## Downloads

### What happened to the simultaneous downloads feature?
It was removed to prevent IP bans caused by too many requests. We know that speed is being sacrificed but it's better than not being able to access a source at all.

## Tracking

### How do I log in with Kitsu?
To log in with Kitsu you need to use your email address as your username.

## Application Updates

### How do I enable automatic updates?
From version **0.9.0** and onwards, Tachiyomi has automatic updates for the app enabled by default. The **Preview** version also has automatic updates enabled by default.

However, if you think you are on an outdated version, go to <Navigation item="more"/> → <Navigation item="about"/> → and click on **Check for updates**.

### Why are automatic updates not working?

Certain devices such as MIUI have very aggressive battery saving, which can kill the app in the background. To whitelist Tachiyomi from battery saver, go to <Navigation item="more"/> → <Navigation item="settings"/> → <Navigation item="settings_advanced"/> and click on **Disable battery optimization**.

## User Interface

### Can I change the app language?
**Tachiyomi** is translated in 40+ different languages. By default, the app follows the language used on your device.
Only the UI has been localized, the language of the manga will still be using the language of the source selected.

:::guide
You can change language by going to <Navigation item="more"/> → <Navigation item="settings"/> → <Navigation item="settings_general"/> then pressing **Language**.

## Miscellaneous

### Will there ever be a dual-page reader option?
The logic required to make a dual-page reader automatically work along with scanlator page inconsistencies and other issues means it is unlikely to be added at this time.
